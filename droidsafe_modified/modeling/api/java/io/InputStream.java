    /**
     * Returns an estimated number of bytes that can be read or skipped without blocking for more
     * input.
     *
     * <p>Note that this method provides such a weak guarantee that it is not very useful in
     * practice.
     *
     * <p>Firstly, the guarantee is "without blocking for more input" rather than "without
     * blocking": a read may still block waiting for I/O to complete&nbsp;&mdash; the guarantee is
     * merely that it won't have to wait indefinitely for data to be written. The result of this
     * method should not be used as a license to do I/O on a thread that shouldn't be blocked.
     *
     * <p>Secondly, the result is a
     * conservative estimate and may be significantly smaller than the actual number of bytes
     * available. In particular, an implementation that always returns 0 would be correct.
     * In general, callers should only use this method if they'd be satisfied with
     * treating the result as a boolean yes or no answer to the question "is there definitely
     * data ready?".
     *
     * <p>Thirdly, the fact that a given number of bytes is "available" does not guarantee that a
     * read or skip will actually read or skip that many bytes: they may read or skip fewer.
     *
     * <p>It is particularly important to realize that you <i>must not</i> use this method to
     * size a container and assume that you can read the entirety of the stream without needing
     * to resize the container. Such callers should probably write everything they read to a
     * {@link ByteArrayOutputStream} and convert that to a byte array. Alternatively, if you're
     * reading from a file, {@link File#length} returns the current length of the file (though
     * assuming the file's length can't change may be incorrect, reading a file is inherently
     * racy).
     *
     * <p>The default implementation of this method in {@code InputStream} always returns 0.
     * Subclasses should override this method if they are able to indicate the number of bytes
     * available.
     *
     * @return the estimated number of bytes available
     * @throws IOException if this stream is closed or an error occurs
