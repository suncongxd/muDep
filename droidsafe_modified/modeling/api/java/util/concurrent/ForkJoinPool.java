/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} for running {@link ForkJoinTask}s.
 * A {@code ForkJoinPool} provides the entry point for submissions
 * from non-{@code ForkJoinTask} clients, as well as management and
 * monitoring operations.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} differs from other kinds of {@link
 * ExecutorService} mainly by virtue of employing
 * <em>work-stealing</em>: all threads in the pool attempt to find and
 * execute tasks submitted to the pool and/or created by other active
 * tasks (eventually blocking waiting for work if none exist). This
 * enables efficient processing when most tasks spawn other subtasks
 * (as do most {@code ForkJoinTask}s), as well as when many small
 * tasks are submitted to the pool from external clients.  Especially
 * when setting <em>asyncMode</em> to true in constructors, {@code
 * ForkJoinPool}s may also be appropriate for use with event-style
 * tasks that are never joined.
 *
 * <p>A static {@link #commonPool()} is available and appropriate for
 * most applications. The common pool is used by any ForkJoinTask that
 * is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool. Using the common
 * pool normally reduces resource usage (its threads are slowly
 * reclaimed during periods of non-use, and reinstated upon subsequent
 * use).
 *
 * <p>For applications that require separate or custom pools, a {@code
 * ForkJoinPool} may be constructed with a given target parallelism
 * level; by default, equal to the number of available processors. The
 * pool attempts to maintain enough active (or available) threads by
 * dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming internal worker
 * threads, even if some tasks are stalled waiting to join
 * others. However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the face of
 * blocked I/O or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested {@link
 * ManagedBlocker} interface enables extension of the kinds of
 * synchronization accommodated.
 *
 * <p>In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this
 * class provides status check methods (for example
 * {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing,
 * tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method
 * {@link #toString} returns indications of pool state in a
 * convenient form for informal monitoring.
 *
 * <p>As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three
 * main task execution methods summarized in the following table.
 * These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already
 * engaged in fork/join computations in the current pool.  The main
 * forms of these methods accept instances of {@code ForkJoinTask},
 * but overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain {@code
 * Runnable}- or {@code Callable}- based activities as well.  However,
 * tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally instead
 * use the within-computation forms listed in the table unless using
 * async event-style tasks that are not usually joined, in which case
 * there is little difference among choice of methods.

    /*
     * Implementation Overview
     *
     * This class and its nested classes provide the main
     * functionality and control for a set of worker threads:
     * Submissions from non-FJ threads enter into submission queues.
     * Workers take these tasks and typically split them into subtasks
     * that may be stolen by other workers.  Preference rules give
     * first priority to processing tasks from their own queues (LIFO
     * or FIFO, depending on mode), then to randomized FIFO steals of
     * tasks in other queues.
     *
     * WorkQueues
     * ==========
     *
     * Most operations occur within work-stealing queues (in nested
     * class WorkQueue).  These are special forms of Deques that
     * support only three of the four possible end-operations -- push,
     * pop, and poll (aka steal), under the further constraints that
     * push and pop are called only from the owning thread (or, as
     * extended here, under a lock), while poll may be called from
     * other threads.  (If you are unfamiliar with them, you probably
     * want to read Herlihy and Shavit's book "The Art of
     * Multiprocessor programming", chapter 16 describing these in
     * more detail before proceeding.)  The main work-stealing queue
     * design is roughly similar to those in the papers "Dynamic
     * Circular Work-Stealing Deque" by Chase and Lev, SPAA 2005
     * (http://research.sun.com/scalable/pubs/index.html) and
     * "Idempotent work stealing" by Michael, Saraswat, and Vechev,
     * PPoPP 2009 (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1504186).
     * The main differences ultimately stem from GC requirements that
     * we null out taken slots as soon as we can, to maintain as small
     * a footprint as possible even in programs generating huge
     * numbers of tasks. To accomplish this, we shift the CAS
     * arbitrating pop vs poll (steal) from being on the indices
     * ("base" and "top") to the slots themselves.  So, both a
     * successful pop and poll mainly entail a CAS of a slot from
     * non-null to null.  Because we rely on CASes of references, we
     * do not need tag bits on base or top.  They are simple ints as
     * used in any circular array-based queue (see for example
     * ArrayDeque).  Updates to the indices must still be ordered in a
     * way that guarantees that top == base means the queue is empty,
     * but otherwise may err on the side of possibly making the queue
     * appear nonempty when a push, pop, or poll have not fully
     * committed. Note that this means that the poll operation,
     * considered individually, is not wait-free. One thief cannot
     * successfully continue until another in-progress one (or, if
     * previously empty, a push) completes.  However, in the
     * aggregate, we ensure at least probabilistic non-blockingness.
     * If an attempted steal fails, a thief always chooses a different
     * random victim target to try next. So, in order for one thief to
     * progress, it suffices for any in-progress poll or new push on
     * any empty queue to complete. (This is why we normally use
     * method pollAt and its variants that try once at the apparent
     * base index, else consider alternative actions, rather than
     * method poll.)
     *
     * This approach also enables support of a user mode in which local
     * task processing is in FIFO, not LIFO order, simply by using
     * poll rather than pop.  This can be useful in message-passing
     * frameworks in which tasks are never joined.  However neither
     * mode considers affinities, loads, cache localities, etc, so
     * rarely provide the best possible performance on a given
     * machine, but portably provide good throughput by averaging over
     * these factors.  (Further, even if we did try to use such
     * information, we do not usually have a basis for exploiting it.
     * For example, some sets of tasks profit from cache affinities,
     * but others are harmed by cache pollution effects.)
     *
     * WorkQueues are also used in a similar way for tasks submitted
     * to the pool. We cannot mix these tasks in the same queues used
     * for work-stealing (this would contaminate lifo/fifo
     * processing). Instead, we randomly associate submission queues
     * with submitting threads, using a form of hashing.  The
     * ThreadLocal Submitter class contains a value initially used as
     * a hash code for choosing existing queues, but may be randomly
     * repositioned upon contention with other submitters.  In
     * essence, submitters act like workers except that they are
     * restricted to executing local tasks that they submitted (or in
     * the case of CountedCompleters, others with the same root task).
     * However, because most shared/external queue operations are more
     * expensive than internal, and because, at steady state, external
     * submitters will compete for CPU with workers, ForkJoinTask.join
     * and related methods disable them from repeatedly helping to
     * process tasks if all workers are active.  Insertion of tasks in
     * shared mode requires a lock (mainly to protect in the case of
     * resizing) but we use only a simple spinlock (using bits in
     * field qlock), because submitters encountering a busy queue move
     * on to try or create other queues -- they block only when
     * creating and registering new queues.
     *
     * Management
     * ==========
     *
     * The main throughput advantages of work-stealing stem from
     * decentralized control -- workers mostly take tasks from
     * themselves or each other. We cannot negate this in the
     * implementation of other management responsibilities. The main
     * tactic for avoiding bottlenecks is packing nearly all
     * essentially atomic control state into two volatile variables
     * that are by far most often read (not written) as status and
     * consistency checks.
     *
     * Field "ctl" contains 64 bits holding all the information needed
     * to atomically decide to add, inactivate, enqueue (on an event
     * queue), dequeue, and/or re-activate workers.  To enable this
     * packing, we restrict maximum parallelism to (1<<15)-1 (which is
     * far in excess of normal operating range) to allow ids, counts,
     * and their negations (used for thresholding) to fit into 16bit
     * fields.
     *
     * Field "plock" is a form of sequence lock with a saturating
     * shutdown bit (similarly for per-queue "qlocks"), mainly
     * protecting updates to the workQueues array, as well as to
     * enable shutdown.  When used as a lock, it is normally only very
     * briefly held, so is nearly always available after at most a
     * brief spin, but we use a monitor-based backup strategy to
     * block when needed.
     *
     * Recording WorkQueues.  WorkQueues are recorded in the
     * "workQueues" array that is created upon first use and expanded
     * if necessary.  Updates to the array while recording new workers
     * and unrecording terminated ones are protected from each other
     * by a lock but the array is otherwise concurrently readable, and
     * accessed directly.  To simplify index-based operations, the
     * array size is always a power of two, and all readers must
     * tolerate null slots. Worker queues are at odd indices. Shared
     * (submission) queues are at even indices, up to a maximum of 64
     * slots, to limit growth even if array needs to expand to add
     * more workers. Grouping them together in this way simplifies and
     * speeds up task scanning.
     *
     * All worker thread creation is on-demand, triggered by task
     * submissions, replacement of terminated workers, and/or
     * compensation for blocked workers. However, all other support
     * code is set up to work with other policies.  To ensure that we
     * do not hold on to worker references that would prevent GC, ALL
     * accesses to workQueues are via indices into the workQueues
     * array (which is one source of some of the messy code
     * constructions here). In essence, the workQueues array serves as
     * a weak reference mechanism. Thus for example the wait queue
     * field of ctl stores indices, not references.  Access to the
     * workQueues in associated methods (for example signalWork) must
     * both index-check and null-check the IDs. All such accesses
     * ignore bad IDs by returning out early from what they are doing,
     * since this can only be associated with termination, in which
     * case it is OK to give up.  All uses of the workQueues array
     * also check that it is non-null (even if previously
     * non-null). This allows nulling during termination, which is
     * currently not necessary, but remains an option for
     * resource-revocation-based shutdown schemes. It also helps
     * reduce JIT issuance of uncommon-trap code, which tends to
     * unnecessarily complicate control flow in some methods.
     *
     * Event Queuing. Unlike HPC work-stealing frameworks, we cannot
     * let workers spin indefinitely scanning for tasks when none can
     * be found immediately, and we cannot start/resume workers unless
     * there appear to be tasks available.  On the other hand, we must
     * quickly prod them into action when new tasks are submitted or
     * generated. In many usages, ramp-up time to activate workers is
     * the main limiting factor in overall performance (this is
     * compounded at program start-up by JIT compilation and
     * allocation). So we try to streamline this as much as possible.
     * We park/unpark workers after placing in an event wait queue
     * when they cannot find work. This "queue" is actually a simple
     * Treiber stack, headed by the "id" field of ctl, plus a 15bit
     * counter value (that reflects the number of times a worker has
     * been inactivated) to avoid ABA effects (we need only as many
     * version numbers as worker threads). Successors are held in
     * field WorkQueue.nextWait.  Queuing deals with several intrinsic
     * races, mainly that a task-producing thread can miss seeing (and
     * signalling) another thread that gave up looking for work but
     * has not yet entered the wait queue. We solve this by requiring
     * a full sweep of all workers (via repeated calls to method
     * scan()) both before and after a newly waiting worker is added
     * to the wait queue. During a rescan, the worker might release
     * some other queued worker rather than itself, which has the same
     * net effect. Because enqueued workers may actually be rescanning
     * rather than waiting, we set and clear the "parker" field of
     * WorkQueues to reduce unnecessary calls to unpark.  (This
     * requires a secondary recheck to avoid missed signals.)  Note
     * the unusual conventions about Thread.interrupts surrounding
     * parking and other blocking: Because interrupts are used solely
     * to alert threads to check termination, which is checked anyway
     * upon blocking, we clear status (using Thread.interrupted)
     * before any call to park, so that park does not immediately
     * return due to status being set via some other unrelated call to
     * interrupt in user code.
     *
     * Signalling.  We create or wake up workers only when there
     * appears to be at least one task they might be able to find and
     * execute. However, many other threads may notice the same task
     * and each signal to wake up a thread that might take it. So in
     * general, pools will be over-signalled.  When a submission is
     * added or another worker adds a task to a queue that has fewer
     * than two tasks, they signal waiting workers (or trigger
     * creation of new ones if fewer than the given parallelism level
     * -- signalWork), and may leave a hint to the unparked worker to
     * help signal others upon wakeup).  These primary signals are
     * buttressed by others (see method helpSignal) whenever other
     * threads scan for work or do not have a task to process.  On
     * most platforms, signalling (unpark) overhead time is noticeably
     * long, and the time between signalling a thread and it actually
     * making progress can be very noticeably long, so it is worth
     * offloading these delays from critical paths as much as
     * possible.
     *
     * Trimming workers. To release resources after periods of lack of
     * use, a worker starting to wait when the pool is quiescent will
     * time out and terminate if the pool has remained quiescent for a
     * given period -- a short period if there are more threads than
     * parallelism, longer as the number of threads decreases. This
     * will slowly propagate, eventually terminating all workers after
     * periods of non-use.
     *
     * Shutdown and Termination. A call to shutdownNow atomically sets
     * a plock bit and then (non-atomically) sets each worker's
     * qlock status, cancels all unprocessed tasks, and wakes up
     * all waiting workers.  Detecting whether termination should
     * commence after a non-abrupt shutdown() call requires more work
     * and bookkeeping. We need consensus about quiescence (i.e., that
     * there is no more work). The active count provides a primary
     * indication but non-abrupt shutdown still requires a rechecking
     * scan for any workers that are inactive but not queued.
     *
     * Joining Tasks
     * =============
     *
     * Any of several actions may be taken when one worker is waiting
     * to join a task stolen (or always held) by another.  Because we
     * are multiplexing many tasks on to a pool of workers, we can't
     * just let them block (as in Thread.join).  We also cannot just
     * reassign the joiner's run-time stack with another and replace
     * it later, which would be a form of "continuation", that even if
     * possible is not necessarily a good idea since we sometimes need
     * both an unblocked task and its continuation to progress.
     * Instead we combine two tactics:
     *
     *   Helping: Arranging for the joiner to execute some task that it
     *      would be running if the steal had not occurred.
     *
     *   Compensating: Unless there are already enough live threads,
     *      method tryCompensate() may create or re-activate a spare
     *      thread to compensate for blocked joiners until they unblock.
     *
     * A third form (implemented in tryRemoveAndExec) amounts to
     * helping a hypothetical compensator: If we can readily tell that
     * a possible action of a compensator is to steal and execute the
     * task being joined, the joining thread can do so directly,
     * without the need for a compensation thread (although at the
     * expense of larger run-time stacks, but the tradeoff is
     * typically worthwhile).
     *
     * The ManagedBlocker extension API can't use helping so relies
     * only on compensation in method awaitBlocker.
     *
     * The algorithm in tryHelpStealer entails a form of "linear"
     * helping: Each worker records (in field currentSteal) the most
     * recent task it stole from some other worker. Plus, it records
     * (in field currentJoin) the task it is currently actively
     * joining. Method tryHelpStealer uses these markers to try to
     * find a worker to help (i.e., steal back a task from and execute
     * it) that could hasten completion of the actively joined task.
     * In essence, the joiner executes a task that would be on its own
     * local deque had the to-be-joined task not been stolen. This may
     * be seen as a conservative variant of the approach in Wagner &
     * Calder "Leapfrogging: a portable technique for implementing
     * efficient futures" SIGPLAN Notices, 1993
     * (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155354). It differs in
     * that: (1) We only maintain dependency links across workers upon
     * steals, rather than use per-task bookkeeping.  This sometimes
     * requires a linear scan of workQueues array to locate stealers,
     * but often doesn't because stealers leave hints (that may become
     * stale/wrong) of where to locate them.  It is only a hint
     * because a worker might have had multiple steals and the hint
     * records only one of them (usually the most current).  Hinting
     * isolates cost to when it is needed, rather than adding to
     * per-task overhead.  (2) It is "shallow", ignoring nesting and
     * potentially cyclic mutual steals.  (3) It is intentionally
     * racy: field currentJoin is updated only while actively joining,
     * which means that we miss links in the chain during long-lived
     * tasks, GC stalls etc (which is OK since blocking in such cases
     * is usually a good idea).  (4) We bound the number of attempts
     * to find work (see MAX_HELP) and fall back to suspending the
     * worker and if necessary replacing it with another.
     *
     * Helping actions for CountedCompleters are much simpler: Method
     * helpComplete can take and execute any task with the same root
     * as the task being waited on. However, this still entails some
     * traversal of completer chains, so is less efficient than using
     * CountedCompleters without explicit joins.
     *
     * It is impossible to keep exactly the target parallelism number
     * of threads running at any given time.  Determining the
     * existence of conservatively safe helping targets, the
     * availability of already-created spares, and the apparent need
     * to create new spares are all racy, so we rely on multiple
     * retries of each.  Compensation in the apparent absence of
     * helping opportunities is challenging to control on JVMs, where
     * GC and other activities can stall progress of tasks that in
     * turn stall out many other dependent tasks, without us being
     * able to determine whether they will ever require compensation.
     * Even though work-stealing otherwise encounters little
     * degradation in the presence of more threads than cores,
     * aggressively adding new threads in such cases entails risk of
     * unwanted positive feedback control loops in which more threads
     * cause more dependent stalls (as well as delayed progress of
     * unblocked threads to the point that we know they are available)
     * leading to more situations requiring more threads, and so
     * on. This aspect of control can be seen as an (analytically
     * intractable) game with an opponent that may choose the worst
     * (for us) active thread to stall at any time.  We take several
     * precautions to bound losses (and thus bound gains), mainly in
     * methods tryCompensate and awaitJoin.
     *
     * Common Pool
     * ===========
     *
     * The static commonPool always exists after static
     * initialization.  Since it (or any other created pool) need
     * never be used, we minimize initial construction overhead and
     * footprint to the setup of about a dozen fields, with no nested
     * allocation. Most bootstrapping occurs within method
     * fullExternalPush during the first submission to the pool.
     *
     * When external threads submit to the common pool, they can
     * perform some subtask processing (see externalHelpJoin and
     * related methods).  We do not need to record whether these
     * submissions are to the common pool -- if not, externalHelpJoin
     * returns quickly (at the most helping to signal some common pool
     * workers). These submitters would otherwise be blocked waiting
     * for completion, so the extra effort (with liberally sprinkled
     * task status checks) in inapplicable cases amounts to an odd
     * form of limited spin-wait before blocking in ForkJoinTask.join.
     *
     * Style notes
     * ===========
     *
     * There is a lot of representation-level coupling among classes
     * ForkJoinPool, ForkJoinWorkerThread, and ForkJoinTask.  The
     * fields of WorkQueue maintain data structures managed by
     * ForkJoinPool, so are directly accessed.  There is little point
     * trying to reduce this, since any associated future changes in
     * representations will need to be accompanied by algorithmic
     * changes anyway. Several methods intrinsically sprawl because
     * they must accumulate sets of consistent reads of volatiles held
     * in local variables.  Methods signalWork() and scan() are the
     * main bottlenecks, so are especially heavily
     * micro-optimized/mangled.  There are lots of inline assignments
     * (of form "while ((local = field) != 0)") which are usually the
     * simplest way to ensure the required read orderings (which are
     * sometimes critical). This leads to a "C"-like style of listing
     * declarations of these locals at the heads of methods or blocks.
     * There are several occurrences of the unusual "do {} while

    /**
     * Queues supporting work-stealing as well as external task
     * submission. See above for main rationale and algorithms.
     * Implementation relies heavily on "Unsafe" intrinsics
     * and selective use of "volatile":
     *
     * Field "base" is the index (mod array.length) of the least valid
     * queue slot, which is always the next position to steal (poll)
     * from if nonempty. Reads and writes require volatile orderings
     * but not CAS, because updates are only performed after slot
     * CASes.
     *
     * Field "top" is the index (mod array.length) of the next queue
     * slot to push to or pop from. It is written only by owner thread
     * for push, or under lock for external/shared push, and accessed
     * by other threads only after reading (volatile) base.  Both top
     * and base are allowed to wrap around on overflow, but (top -
     * base) (or more commonly -(base - top) to force volatile read of
     * base before top) still estimates size. The lock ("qlock") is
     * forced to -1 on termination, causing all further lock attempts
     * to fail. (Note: we don't need CAS for termination state because
     * upon pool shutdown, all shared-queues will stop being used
     * anyway.)  Nearly all lock bodies are set up so that exceptions
     * within lock bodies are "impossible" (modulo JVM errors that
     * would cause failure anyway.)
     *
     * The array slots are read and written using the emulation of
     * volatiles/atomics provided by Unsafe. Insertions must in
     * general use putOrderedObject as a form of releasing store to
     * ensure that all writes to the task object are ordered before
     * its publication in the queue.  All removals entail a CAS to
     * null.  The array is always a power of two. To ensure safety of
     * Unsafe array operations, all accesses perform explicit null
     * checks and implicit bounds checks via power-of-two masking.
     *
     * In addition to basic queuing support, this class contains
     * fields described elsewhere to control execution. It turns out
     * to work better memory-layout-wise to include them in this class
     * rather than a separate class.
     *
     * Performance on most platforms is very sensitive to placement of
     * instances of both WorkQueues and their arrays -- we absolutely
     * do not want multiple WorkQueue instances or multiple queue
     * arrays sharing cache lines. (It would be best for queue objects
     * and their arrays to share, but there is nothing available to
     * help arrange that).  Unfortunately, because they are recorded
     * in a common array, WorkQueue instances are often moved to be
     * adjacent by garbage collectors. To reduce impact, we use field
     * padding that works OK on common platforms; this effectively
     * trades off slightly slower average field access for the sake of
     * avoiding really bad worst-case access. (Until better JVM
     * support is in place, this padding is dependent on transient
     * properties of JVM field layout rules.) We also take care in
     * allocating, sizing and resizing the array. Non-shared queue
     * arrays are initialized by workers before use. Others are
     * allocated on first use.

    /**
     * Returns a cheap heuristic guide for task partitioning when
     * programmers, frameworks, tools, or languages have little or no
     * idea about task granularity.  In essence by offering this
     * method, we ask users only about tradeoffs in overhead vs
     * expected throughput and its variance, rather than how finely to
     * partition tasks.
     *
     * In a steady state strict (tree-structured) computation, each
     * thread makes available for stealing enough tasks for other
     * threads to remain active. Inductively, if all threads play by
     * the same rules, each thread should make available only a
     * constant number of tasks.
     *
     * The minimum useful constant is just 1. But using a value of 1
     * would require immediate replenishment upon each steal to
     * maintain enough tasks, which is infeasible.  Further,
     * partitionings/granularities of offered tasks should minimize
     * steal rates, which in general means that threads nearer the top
     * of computation tree should generate more than those nearer the
     * bottom. In perfect steady state, each thread is at
     * approximately the same level of computation tree. However,
     * producing extra tasks amortizes the uncertainty of progress and
     * diffusion assumptions.
     *
     * So, users will want to use values larger (but not much larger)
     * than 1 to both smooth over transient shortages and hedge
     * against uneven progress; as traded off against the cost of
     * extra task overhead. We leave the user to pick a threshold
     * value to compare with the results of this call to guide
     * decisions, but recommend values such as 3.
     *
     * When all threads are active, it is on average OK to estimate
     * surplus strictly locally. In steady-state, if one thread is
     * maintaining say 2 surplus tasks, then so are others. So we can
     * just use estimated queue length.  However, this strategy alone
     * leads to serious mis-estimates in some non-steady-state
     * conditions (ramp-up, ramp-down, other stalls). We can detect
     * many of these by further considering the number of "idle"
     * threads, that are known to have zero queued tasks, so
     * compensate by a factor of (#idle/#active) threads.
     *
     * Note: The approximation of #busy workers as #active workers is
     * not very good under current signalling scheme, and should be
     * improved.

     * Interface for extending managed parallelism for tasks running
     * in {@link ForkJoinPool}s.
     *
     * <p>A {@code ManagedBlocker} provides two methods.  Method
     * {@code isReleasable} must return {@code true} if blocking is
     * not necessary. Method {@code block} blocks the current thread
     * if necessary (perhaps internally invoking {@code isReleasable}
     * before actually blocking). These actions are performed by any
     * thread invoking {@link ForkJoinPool#managedBlock}.  The
     * unusual methods in this API accommodate synchronizers that may,
     * but don't usually, block for long periods. Similarly, they
     * allow more efficient internal handling of cases in which
     * additional workers may be, but usually are not, needed to
     * ensure sufficient parallelism.  Toward this end,
     * implementations of method {@code isReleasable} must be amenable
     * to repeated invocation.
     *
     * <p>For example, here is a ManagedBlocker based on a
     * ReentrantLock:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class ManagedLocker implements ManagedBlocker {
     *   final ReentrantLock lock;
     *   boolean hasLock = false;
     *   ManagedLocker(ReentrantLock lock) { this.lock = lock; }
     *   public boolean block() {
     *     if (!hasLock)
     *       lock.lock();
     *     return true;
     *   }
     *   public boolean isReleasable() {
     *     return hasLock || (hasLock = lock.tryLock());
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>Here is a class that possibly blocks waiting for an
     * item on a given queue:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class QueueTaker<E> implements ManagedBlocker {
     *   final BlockingQueue<E> queue;
     *   volatile E item = null;
     *   QueueTaker(BlockingQueue<E> q) { this.queue = q; }
     *   public boolean block() throws InterruptedException {
     *     if (item == null)
     *       item = queue.take();
     *     return true;
     *   }
     *   public boolean isReleasable() {
     *     return item != null || (item = queue.poll()) != null;
     *   }
     *   public E getItem() { // call after pool.managedBlock completes
     *     return item;
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     */
