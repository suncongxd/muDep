/**
 * The class specifying the interface to extend the certification path
 * validation algorithm by checks to perform on an {@code X509Certificate}.
 * <p>
 * The checks are added to a certification path validation using the
 * {@link PKIXParameters#setCertPathCheckers(java.util.List)
 * setCertPathCheckers} or
 * {@link PKIXBuilderParameters#addCertPathChecker(PKIXCertPathChecker)
 * addCertPathChecker} of the {@code PKIXParameters} and {@code
 * PKIXBuilderParameters} class respectively. The
 * {@link #check(Certificate, Collection) check} method will be called for each
 * certificate processed by a {@code CertPathBuilder} of {@code
 * CertPathValidator}.
 * <p>
 * A {@code PKIXCertPathChecker} implementation <u>must</u> support reverse
 * checking (from trusted CA to target) and <u>may</u> support forward checking
 * (from target to trusted CA). The return value of {@code
 * isForwardCheckingSupported} indicates whether forward checking is supported.
