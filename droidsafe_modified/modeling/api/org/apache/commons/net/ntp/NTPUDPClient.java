/***
 * The NTPUDPClient class is a UDP implementation of a client for the
 * Network Time Protocol (NTP) described in RFC 1305 as well as the
 * Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) in RFC-2030. To use the class,
 * merely open a local datagram socket with <a href="#open"> open </a>
 * and call <a href="#getTime"> getTime </a> to retrieve the time. Then call
 * <a href="org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient.html#close"> close </a>
 * to close the connection properly.
 * Successive calls to <a href="#getTime"> getTime </a> are permitted
 * without re-establishing a connection.  That is because UDP is a
 * connectionless protocol and the Network Time Protocol is stateless.
