 * The EchoUDPClient class is a UDP implementation of a client for the

 * just open a local UDP port

 * and call {@link #send  send } to send datagrams to the server,
 * then call {@link #receive  receive } to receive echoes.
 * After you're done echoing data, call
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#close  close() }
 * to clean up properly.
