/***
 * The CharGenUDPClient class is a UDP implementation of a client for the
 * character generator protocol described in RFC 864.  It can also be
 * used for Systat (RFC 866), Quote of the Day (RFC 865), and netstat
 * (port 15).  All of these protocols involve sending a datagram to the
 * appropriate port, and reading data contained in one or more reply
 * datagrams.  The chargen and quote of the day protocols only send
 * one reply datagram containing 512 bytes or less of data.  The other
 * protocols may reply with more than one datagram, in which case you
 * must wait for a timeout to determine that all reply datagrams have
 * been sent.
 * <p>
 * To use the CharGenUDPClient class, just open a local UDP port
 * with {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#open  open }
 * and call {@link #send  send } to send the datagram that will
 * initiate the data reply.  For chargen or quote of the day, just
 * call {@link #receive  receive }, and you're done.  For netstat and
 * systat, call receive in a while loop, and catch a SocketException and
 * InterruptedIOException to detect a timeout (don't forget to set the
 * timeout duration beforehand).  Don't forget to call
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#close  close() }
 * to clean up properly.
