/***
 * NNTPClient encapsulates all the functionality necessary to post and
 * retrieve articles from an NNTP server.  As with all classes derived
 * from {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient},
 * you must first connect to the server with
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#connect  connect }
 * before doing anything, and finally
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#disconnect  disconnect() }
 * after you're completely finished interacting with the server.
 * Remember that the
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#isAllowedToPost isAllowedToPost()}
 *  method is defined in
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP}.
 * <p>
 * You should keep in mind that the NNTP server may choose to prematurely
 * close a connection if the client has been idle for longer than a
 * given time period or if the server is being shutdown by the operator or
 * some other reason.  The NNTP class will detect a
 * premature NNTP server connection closing when it receives a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPReply#SERVICE_DISCONTINUED NNTPReply.SERVICE_DISCONTINUED }
 *  response to a command.
 * When that occurs, the NNTP class method encountering that reply will throw
 * an {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPConnectionClosedException}
 * .
 * <code>NNTPConectionClosedException</code>
 * is a subclass of <code> IOException </code> and therefore need not be
 * caught separately, but if you are going to catch it separately, its
 * catch block must appear before the more general <code> IOException </code>
 * catch block.  When you encounter an
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTPConnectionClosedException}
 * , you must disconnect the connection with
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#disconnect  disconnect() }
 *  to properly clean up the
 * system resources used by NNTP.  Before disconnecting, you may check the
 * last reply code and text with
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#getReplyCode  getReplyCode } and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.nntp.NNTP#getReplyString  getReplyString }.
 * <p>
 * Rather than list it separately for each method, we mention here that
 * every method communicating with the server and throwing an IOException
 * can also throw a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.MalformedServerReplyException}
 * , which is a subclass
 * of IOException.  A MalformedServerReplyException will be thrown when
 * the reply received from the server deviates enough from the protocol
 * specification that it cannot be interpreted in a useful manner despite
 * attempts to be as lenient as possible.
