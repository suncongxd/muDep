/***
 * The WhoisClient class implements the client side of the Internet Whois
 * Protocol defined in RFC 954.   To query a host you create a
 * WhoisClient instance, connect to the host, query the host, and finally
 * disconnect from the host.  If the whois service you want to query is on
 * a non-standard port, connect to the host at that port.
 * Here's a sample use:
 * <pre>
 *    WhoisClient whois;
 *
 *    whois = new WhoisClient();
 *
 *    try {
 *      whois.connect(WhoisClient.DEFAULT_HOST);
 *      System.out.println(whois.query("foobar"));
 *      whois.disconnect();
 *    } catch(IOException e) {
 *      System.err.println("Error I/O exception: " + e.getMessage());
 *      return;
 *    }
 * </pre>
