 * Strategy for deleting files.
 * <p>
 * There is more than one way to delete a file.
 * You may want to limit access to certain directories, to only delete
 * directories if they are empty, or maybe to force deletion.
 * <p>
 * This class captures the strategy to use and is designed for user subclassing.
