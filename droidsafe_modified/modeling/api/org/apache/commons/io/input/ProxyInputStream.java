 * It is an alternative base class to FilterInputStream
 * to increase reusability, because FilterInputStream changes the
 * methods being called, such as read(byte[]) to read(byte[], int, int).

 * See the protected methods for ways in which a subclass can easily decorate
 * a stream with custom pre-, post- or error processing functionality.
