/**
 * An output stream which will retain data in memory until a specified
 * threshold is reached, and only then commit it to disk. If the stream is
 * closed before the threshold is reached, the data will not be written to
 * disk at all.
 * <p>
 * This class originated in FileUpload processing. In this use case, you do
 * not know in advance the size of the file being uploaded. If the file is small
 * you want to store it in memory (for speed), but if the file is large you want
 * to store it to file (to avoid memory issues).
