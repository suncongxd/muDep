 * Character encoding names required of every implementation of the Java platform.
 *
 * From the Java documentation <a
 * href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html">Standard charsets</a>:
 * <p>
 * <cite>Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the following character encodings. Consult the
 * release documentation for your implementation to see if any other encodings are supported. Consult the release
 * documentation for your implementation to see if any other encodings are supported.</cite>
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>US-ASCII</code><br/>
 * Seven-bit ASCII, a.k.a. ISO646-US, a.k.a. the Basic Latin block of the Unicode character set.</li>
 * <li><code>ISO-8859-1</code><br/>
 * ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1, a.k.a. ISO-LATIN-1.</li>
 * <li><code>UTF-8</code><br/>
 * Eight-bit Unicode Transformation Format.</li>
 * <li><code>UTF-16BE</code><br/>
 * Sixteen-bit Unicode Transformation Format, big-endian byte order.</li>
 * <li><code>UTF-16LE</code><br/>
 * Sixteen-bit Unicode Transformation Format, little-endian byte order.</li>
 * <li><code>UTF-16</code><br/>
 * Sixteen-bit Unicode Transformation Format, byte order specified by a mandatory initial byte-order mark (either order
 * accepted on input, big-endian used on output.)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This perhaps would best belong in the [lang] project. Even if a similar interface is defined in [lang], it is not
 * foreseen that [codec] would be made to depend on [lang].
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
