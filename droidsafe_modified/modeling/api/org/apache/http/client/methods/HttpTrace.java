/**
 * HTTP TRACE method.
 * <p>
 * The HTTP TRACE method is defined in section 9.6 of 
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a>:
 * <blockquote>
 *  The TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop-
 *  back of the request message. The final recipient of the request
 *  SHOULD reflect the message received back to the client as the
 *  entity-body of a 200 (OK) response. The final recipient is either the
 *  origin server or the first proxy or gateway to receive a Max-Forwards
 *  value of zero (0) in the request (see section 14.31). A TRACE request
 *  MUST NOT include an entity.
 * </blockquote>
 * </p>

 * @version $Revision: 664505 $
