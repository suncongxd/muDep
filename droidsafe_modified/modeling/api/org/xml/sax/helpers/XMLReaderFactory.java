     * Attempt to create an XMLReader from system defaults.
     * In environments which can support it, the name of the XMLReader
     * class is determined by trying each these options in order, and
     * using the first one which succeeds:</p> <ul>
     *
     * <li>If the system property <code>org.xml.sax.driver</code>
     * has a value, that is used as an XMLReader class name. </li>
     *
     * <li>The JAR "Services API" is used to look for a class name
     * in the <em>META-INF/services/org.xml.sax.driver</em> file in
     * jarfiles available to the runtime.</li>
     *
     * <li> SAX parser distributions are strongly encouraged to provide
     * a default XMLReader class name that will take effect only when
     * previous options (on this list) are not successful.</li>
     *
     * <li>Finally, if {@link ParserFactory#makeParser()} can
     * return a system default SAX1 parser, that parser is wrapped in
     * a {@link ParserAdapter}.  (This is a migration aid for SAX1
     * environments, where the <code>org.xml.sax.parser</code> system
     * property will often be usable.) </li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p> In environments such as small embedded systems, which can not
     * support that flexibility, other mechanisms to determine the default
     * may be used. </p>
     *
     * <p>Note that many Java environments allow system properties to be
     * initialized on a command line.  This means that <em>in most cases</em>
     * setting a good value for that property ensures that calls to this
     * method will succeed, except when security policies intervene.
     * This will also maximize application portability to older SAX
     * environments, with less robust implementations of this method.
     * </p>
     *
     * @return A new XMLReader.
     * @exception org.xml.sax.SAXException If no default XMLReader class
     *            can be identified and instantiated.
