/**
 * Acoustic Echo Canceler (AEC).
 * <p>Acoustic Echo Canceler (AEC) is an audio pre-processing which removes the contribution of the
 * signal received from the remote party from the captured audio signal.
 * <p>AEC is used by voice communication applications (voice chat, video conferencing, SIP calls)
 * where the presence of echo with significant delay in the signal received from the remote party
 * is highly disturbing. AEC is often used in conjunction with noise suppression (NS).
 * <p>An application creates an AcousticEchoCanceler object to instantiate and control an AEC
 * engine in the audio capture path.
 * <p>To attach the AcousticEchoCanceler to a particular {@link android.media.AudioRecord},
 * specify the audio session ID of this AudioRecord when constructing the AcousticEchoCanceler.
 * The audio session is retrieved by calling
 * {@link android.media.AudioRecord#getAudioSessionId()} on the AudioRecord instance.
 * <p>On some devices, an AEC can be inserted by default in the capture path by the platform
 * according to the {@link android.media.MediaRecorder.AudioSource} used. The application can
 * query which pre-processings are currently applied to an AudioRecord instance by calling
 * {@link android.media.audiofx.AudioEffect#queryPreProcessings(int)} with the audio session of the
 * AudioRecord.
 * <p>See {@link android.media.audiofx.AudioEffect} class for more details on
 * controlling audio effects.
