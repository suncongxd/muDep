 * 1) Instanciate a LatencyTimer as a class field.
 *      private [static] LatencyTimer mLt = new LatencyTimer(100, 1000);
 * 2) At various points in the code call sample with a string and the time delta to some fixed time.
 *    The string should be unique at each point of the code you are measuring.
 *      mLt.sample("before processing event", System.nanoTime() - event.getEventTimeNano());
