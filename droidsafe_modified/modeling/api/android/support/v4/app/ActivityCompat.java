     * Invalidate the activity's options menu, if able.
     *
     * <p>Before API level 11 (Android 3.0/Honeycomb) the lifecycle of the
     * options menu was controlled primarily by the user's operation of
     * the hardware menu key. When the user presses down on the menu key
     * for the first time the menu was created and prepared by calls
     * to {@link Activity#onCreateOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu)} and
     * {@link Activity#onPrepareOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu)} respectively.
     * Subsequent presses of the menu key kept the existing instance of the
     * Menu itself and called {@link Activity#onPrepareOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu)}
     * to give the activity an opportunity to contextually alter the menu
     * before the menu panel was shown.</p>
     *
     * <p>In Android 3.0+ the Action Bar forces the options menu to be built early
     * so that items chosen to show as actions may be displayed when the activity
     * first becomes visible. The Activity method invalidateOptionsMenu forces
     * the entire menu to be destroyed and recreated from
     * {@link Activity#onCreateOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu)}, offering a similar
     * though heavier-weight opportunity to change the menu's contents. Normally
     * this functionality is used to support a changing configuration of Fragments.</p>
     *
     * <p>Applications may use this support helper to signal a significant change in
     * activity state that should cause the options menu to be rebuilt. If the app
     * is running on an older platform version that does not support menu invalidation
     * the app will still receive {@link Activity#onPrepareOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu)}
     * the next time the user presses the menu key and this method will return false.
     * If this method returns true the options menu was successfully invalidated.</p>
     *
     * @param activity Invalidate the options menu of this activity
     * @return true if this operation was supported and it completed; false if it was not available.

     *
     * <p>In API level 11 (Android 3.0/Honeycomb) the recommended conventions for
     * app navigation using the back key changed. The back key's behavior is local
     * to the current task and does not capture navigation across different tasks.
     * Navigating across tasks and easily reaching the previous task is accomplished
     * through the "recents" UI, accessible through the software-provided Recents key
     * on the navigation or system bar. On devices with the older hardware button configuration
     * the recents UI can be accessed with a long press on the Home key.</p>
     *
     * <p>When crossing from one task stack to another post-Android 3.0,
     * the application should synthesize a back stack/history for the new task so that
     * the user may navigate out of the new task and back to the Launcher by repeated
     * presses of the back key. Back key presses should not navigate across task stacks.</p>
